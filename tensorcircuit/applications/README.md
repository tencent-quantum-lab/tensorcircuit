Code implementation in this submodule `applications` are not very well maintained and extensively tested. There are indeed many interesting pieces, but try on your own risk.


## Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search

In `applications`, framework and relevant applications of DQAS are implemented, mainly in `vags.py` and `dqas.py`.

The entrypoint of DQAS framework is `DQAS_search` and `DQAS_search_pmb` for advanced probabilistic model based DQAS.
One can also check [examples](/examples) for integrated example demos.

## Variational Quantum-Neural Hybrid Eigensolver

The main library functions and utilities are in `vqes.py`. Also see [examples](/examples) including `vqnhe_h6.py` and `adiabatic_vqnhe.py`.
