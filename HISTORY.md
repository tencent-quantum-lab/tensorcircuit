TensorCircuit is initially a personal project created by @refraction-ray (Shi-Xin Zhang). He began this project in April 2020, inspired by the MPS quantum simulator [mpsim](https://github.com/grmlarose/mpsim) and the introduction of the Google [TensorNetwork](https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork) package. This project is further developed by him during 2020 and the first half of 2021 when he was a Ph.D. candidate at Tsinghua University, with multiple new features and applications added for his research purpose. The original TensorCircuit project is archived now on [GitHub](https://github.com/refraction-ray/tensorcircuit/). He decided to make this project a more universal open-source framework after he joined Tencent in July 2021. And he has extensively refactored and optimized the codebase since then. As the creator and the lead author of TensorCircuit, he thanks all the [contributors](https://github.com/tencent-quantum-lab/tensorcircuit#contributors) who have made TensorCircuit and the ecosystem better.
