TensorCircuit is an open source quantum circuit and algorithm simulation framework.

* It is built for human beings. 👽

* It is designed for speed, flexibility and elegance. 🚀

* It is empowered by advanced tensor network simulator engine. 🔋

* It is implemented with industry-standard machine learning frameworks: TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. 🤖

* It is compatible with machine learning engineering paradigms: automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, vectorized parallelism and GPU acceleration. 🛠
