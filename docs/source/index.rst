**Welcome and congratulations! You have found TensorCircuit.** üëè 

Introduction
---------------

TensorCircuit is an open-source high-performance quantum computing software framework in Python.

* It is built for humans. üëΩ

* It is designed for speed, flexibility and elegance. üöÄ

* It is empowered by advanced tensor network simulator engine. üîã

* It is ready for quantum hardware access with CPU/GPU/QPU (local/cloud) hybrid solutions. üñ•

* It is implemented with industry-standard machine learning frameworks: TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. ü§ñ

* It is compatible with machine learning engineering paradigms: automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, vectorized parallelism and GPU acceleration. üõ†

With the help of TensorCircuit, now get ready to efficiently and elegantly solve interesting and challenging quantum computing problems: from academic research prototype to industry application deployment.
